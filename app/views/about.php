<p>Since this is just PHP code, you can always just (and sometimes its easier) include a longer content page rather than going through the translator.  You could also put the language files in subdirectories.  Its up to you!</p>

&lt? require 'about_'.$lang.'.php' ?&gt;

<? require 'about_'.$lang.'.php' ?>
